##Things to cover
- Webpack
- Basic React Review
- Component Life-Cycle
- Asynchronous Data
- Small JS Context Review
- Default Props
- Prop Types

###Webpack
- Dependencies
	- --save vs --save-dev
	- File Tree
	- `import` vs `module.exports`
- Loaders
	- JSX
	- es6
		- Babel and Babel Config
	- CSS
	- Basically anything you could ever need
- Config

	- Ouput
	- Loaders

###Basic React Review

	- getInitalState
	- setState
- Event Handlers
	- onClick
	- onKeyUp
	- onWhateverElseYouNeed
- Props
	- <Component prop={value} />
	- this.props

###Component Life-Cycle
- Mounting
	- componentWillMount
	- componentDidMount
- Updating
	- componentWillReceiveProps
- Unmounting
	- componentWillUnmount

###Small JS Context Review
- Function.prototype.bind
	- Context
	- Currying

###Asynchronous Data
- jQuery?
- Other (better) options
- Axios
	- $http vs Axios
- Where?
- When?
- From promise/callback to state

###Default Props
- Easy to implement
- Why to implement

###Prop Types
- Types
	- Javascript Types
- How
- Why

###Mixins
- [Goodbye Mixins](!https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.u56vju3gt)

###Mini Project
- Try not to get lost in the steps
- Continually think of what you're trying to build over what you think the step wants
- You're learning how JavaScript works more than React-specific syntax
