###Webpack
- Dependencies
	- --save vs --save-dev
	- File Tree
	- `import` vs `module.exports`

###Small JS Context Review
- Function.prototype.bind
	- Context
	- Partial Application

###Asynchronous Data
- jQuery?
- Other (better) options
- Axios
	- $http vs Axios
- Where?
- When?
- From promise/callback to state

###Default Props
- Easy to implement
- Why to implement

###Prop Types
- Types
	- Javascript Types

###Mixins
- [Goodbye Mixins!](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/mixins-are-dead-long-live-higher-order-components-94a0d2f9e750#.u56vju3gt)

###Mini Project
- Try not to get lost in the steps
- Continually think of what you're trying to build over what you think the step wants
- You're learning how JavaScript works more than React-specific syntax
